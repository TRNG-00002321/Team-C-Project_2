# Project Requirements Document: Revature Expense Manager – Phase 3

## Overview
In Phase 3, **Revature Expense Manager** transitions into a fully containerized and automated deployment pipeline. The focus is on integrating the existing Python and Java web applications, along with their testing suites, into a CI/CD pipeline using Docker and Jenkins. The pipeline will be hosted on AWS and designed to build, test, and deploy both applications automatically.

---

## Technologies Used
- **Docker** – Containerization of both Python and Java applications
- **Jenkins** – CI/CD orchestration
- **AWS** – Cloud hosting for Jenkins and deployment targets
- **Git** – Source control and trigger for pipeline execution

---

## CI/CD MVP Requirements

### Containerization
- Each application (Python and Java) must be containerized using Docker
- Dockerfiles must:
  - Install dependencies
  - Expose necessary ports
  - Run the application in a production-ready state
- Docker Compose may be used to orchestrate multi-container setups (e.g., app + database)

### CI/CD Pipeline (Jenkins)
- Jenkins must be configured to:
  - Pull code from Git repository
  - Build Docker images for both applications
  - Run unit and API tests
  - Deploy containers to a target environment
- Pipelines should be triggered by Git events

### Testing Integration
- Existing unit, API, performance, and E2E tests must be executed as part of the pipeline
- Test results should be visible in Jenkins (e.g., via plugins or console output)

### AWS Hosting
- Jenkins must be hosted on AWS
- Credentials and secrets must be managed securely

## Deliverables
- Dockerfiles for both applications
- Jenkinsfile or Jenkins pipeline configuration
- AWS-hosted Jenkins instance
- CI/CD pipeline that builds, tests, and deploys both apps
- Documentation outlining setup, pipeline flow, and deployment steps
